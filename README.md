### Hi there 👋, my name is Martin
I am a polyglot programmer and open source enthusiast, working as a consultant at [Forse](https://forse.no/) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csmoore/country-flag-icons/8f7c50904bb7080b8aef99c3fa836305117bcbc1/country-flags-4x3-svg/no.svg" height="12" />

* I've built
  * [Mediator](https://github.com/martinothamar/Mediator) - a fast (close to 0 overhead) sourcegenerator-based mediator pattern implementation in .NET
  * [Fast.PRNGs.NET](https://github.com/martinothamar/Fast.PRNGs.NET) - fast PRNG implementations (up to 2.5x faster than `System.Random`)
  * [simd-rand](https://github.com/martinothamar/simd-rand) - SIMD implementations of common PRNGs in Rust 🦀 (for example Xoshiro256+ ~50 GiB/s u64 gen using AVX512 on my laptop, about 5x faster than non-vectorized)
  * ["building x in y"](https://github.com/martinothamar/building-x-in-y) - experiments and learning about systems programming, programming languages, architectures and designs
    * [Simulating football seasons using the Monte Carlo method](https://github.com/martinothamar/building-x-in-y/tree/main/monte-carlo-sim) - lots of SIMD and performance engineering
* Currently exploring
  * **Rust**, **Zig** and **Go** - I think Rust is a very good _high level_ language. Zig seems like a great C replacement

I strive to make simple, observable systems - employing [mechanical sympathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC1EKLQ2Wmg) and low level understanding to build efficient and reliable software.
